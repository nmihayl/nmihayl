## About Me

Hi, I'm Nick. 

This profile is primarily for personal projects and keeping track of stuff I'm interested in. My primary interest is in audio software and music production, though I also value FOSS and Libre software that isn't user-hostile.

Personal code of conduct is no politics are to be involved as they are mostly a tool to divide and segregate people and to distract them from making cool things. Don't be an ass and you're alright.

At the moment I'm doing re-training as a system administrator and integrator at GFN GmbH in Freiburg, Germany. Throughout my attendance I will most likely work on a bunch of projects and make them available here.

I also happen to make electronic music in the style of IDM as [hellio](https://hellio.bandcamp.com/) and more alternative rock/noise-oriented stuff [tilde](https://nikolamihaylovtilde.bandcamp.com/music), as well as operate a netlabel called [HELL INTERFACING](https://hi.helliolab.giize.com/) with a couple of friends of mine. Feel free to stop by if you want to hear some mediocrity!

Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
